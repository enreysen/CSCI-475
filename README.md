This folder contains the final project for CSCI 475. My teammate and I developed a website that displays information 
from a MySQL database by integrating it with PHP files. The project is centered around the game Marvel Rivals and 
features detailed information about characters, maps, season data, and in-game team-ups. Users can create, update, 
and delete entries for characters, maps, seasons, and team-ups directly through the website.

Please note: the site is only accessible from the University of Mississippiâ€™s campus.
